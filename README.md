# Udacity_Deep_RL_Navigation_Project
This project uses deep Q network to solve Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning class's Unity Banana environment.The deep Q network agent is implemented based on Pytorch in jupyter notebook. The environement is considered solved when the agent receives an average reward (over 100 episodes) > 13.

## The Unity Banana Environment

The agent get +1 reward for getting a yellow banana and -1 for getting a blue banana. Each episode lasts 300 time stamps. The state space has 37 dimensions and the action space has 4 dimensions.

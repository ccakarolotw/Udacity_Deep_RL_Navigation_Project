# Udacity_Deep_RL_Navigation_Project
This project uses deep Q network to solve Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning class's Unity Banana environment
The deep Q network agent is implemented based on Pytorch in jupyter notebook. The environement is considered solved when the agent receives an average reward (over 100 episodes) > 13.
